  <textarea rows=30 cols=100 style="font-family:courier" name="text">To follow an algebraic premise:

ab = c

Input variables:

a = wife 

b = husband 1

c = the product of an unhappy marriage



Break up the equation. Remove b, substitute d.


a = wife

d = husband 2



a x d creates a successful marriage. 
By the reflexive property, a = a. 
Meanwhile, relative to a, husband 2 > husband 1, therefore d > a. 



Account for potential negatives -- consider it all in absolute values.


ad = e
abs(ad) = abs(e)


the absolute value of e > the absolute value of c 

e is the product of a happy marriage.

e stands for "elusive." Something sacred attained. To be clenched almost desperately.

e stands for "eclipsed," like the lesser value of c.  

e should stand for "step-sister," should it not? By logic. By logic.


c can sound like s, for "Sebastian."



c, being the product of an unhappy marriage, dips beneath the horizon, sinks
  
through the ground floor of this stable, happy house.



Being a night-dweller drawn to the earth, c lives at the bottom of a pot of coffee.

c loves coffee.

c is aware of his unhealthy lifestyle.

c is becoming his coffee: clad in black, dripping

first to the lowest pot point: the burner.

c is cooking, slowly, slowly.
c is growing

bitter and burnt.
